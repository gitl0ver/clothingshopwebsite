      <p><b>Trendsetters is a fashion-forward store for finding clothes, accessories and more. We have been designing clothes and selling them at the Manhattan Mall in New York City for over 25 years. We offer a variety of...well...a lot of really cool stuff. I'm really bad at writing descriptions for these places. I hope that this is a suitable website. As you can see, I have the list on the left (I even animated it!), I've got the gallery of images working on the screen here. And there will be more to see with tables, videos, forms and such, on the other pages. To be honest, I didn't spent as much time polishing the other elements as I did the menu, which I feel bad about...hopefully next time I can get everything looking good. The w3schools site is really useful for learning about all the stuff you can do in HTML and CSS.</b></p>
